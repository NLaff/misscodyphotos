# About

### Hi! I'm Cody.
I'm  an retoucher with over 10 years experience based out of Austin, Texas. I primarily retouch architecture, portraits, and products but I can make just about any image look great. All of the images featured on this site are completed retouches from clients I have worked with.


### Rates
Please [contact me](/contact) to inquire about my rates! I charge on an hourly basis. Typical photos can take between 20 minutes to an hour to complete depending on the complexity of the request. I'm happy to discuss bulk rates for extremely large jobs.
